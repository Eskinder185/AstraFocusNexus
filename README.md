Define â€¢ Do â€¢ Done

AstraFocus is my take on making productivity fun. Itâ€™s a task tracker combined with a Pomodoro timer, wrapped in a glowing cyber-theme with a live particle background. I built it to sharpen my React + TypeScript skills while creating something Iâ€™d actually use to stay focused.


What it does

Task Tracker â†’ add, complete, and clear tasks with optional due dates

Reminders â†’ browser notifications for deadlines

Pomodoro Timer â†’ Focus / Short break / Long break cycles that log against active tasks

Neon UI â†’ Animated particle background + glowing buttons that make it feel alive

Try it locally
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/Eskinder185/tasktracker.git
cd tasktracker

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the dev server
npm start


The app will open at http://localhost:3000

 Why I built this

I didnâ€™t just want another plain to-do app. AstraFocus is my sandbox for learning, but also something I rely on. The Pomodoro sessions help me code longer without burning out, and the neon aesthetic keeps me motivated â€” because if Iâ€™m staring at a screen for hours, it might as well look cool ðŸ˜….

This is a personal learning project, but if youâ€™ve got cool ideas, feel free to fork it, tweak it, or open an issue.
